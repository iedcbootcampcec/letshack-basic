# Spanning Tree:-

# -No Cycle (Hence tree)
# -it is a subgraph of graph
# where,
#       subgraph =(V,E)
#              V = V
#              E = |V-1|


# * Number of Spanning for Complete Graph = n^n-2  where, n = no of nodes/vertex
# * Number of Spanning for In-Complete Graph =  using kirchorff's theoram
