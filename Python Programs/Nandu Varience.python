# Python code to demonstrate the working of 

# variance() function of Statistics Module 

  

# Importing Statistics module 

import statistics 

  

# Creating a sample of data 

sample = [2.74, 1.23, 2.63, 2.22, 3, 1.98] 

  

# Prints variance of the sample set 

  

# Function will automatically calculate 

# it's mean and set it as xbar 

print("Variance of sample set is % s"
